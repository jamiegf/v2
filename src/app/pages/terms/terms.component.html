      18 years old or over, that you are resident in the country in which you
      say you are a resident and/or that your identity matches the identity of
      the sources of deposits in your User Account. If this is not the case, we

    <h4 class="small-subhead">5.1 The Website and the Services</h4>
    <p class="panel-text">
      MiPools allows Users to access the pools as provided and managed by
      MiPools Limited, a licensed gambling software provider (licence no.
      036291-R-317480-009). Access to the Website is subject to these Terms &
      Conditions and the pools are governed by the Pool Rules. Please read both
      carefully before entering any pools and Contact Us if you have any
      questions:
      <a href="mailto:helpdesk@mipools.co.uk">helpdesk&#64;mipools.co.uk</a>
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      MiPools provides its Services exclusively through the Website.
    </p>

    <h4 class="small-subhead">5.2 The Pools</h4>
    <p class="panel-text">We currently operate the following pool types:</p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      <span>Predictor Pools:</span> pools requiring Users to make predictions
      relating to an underlying event;
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      <span>Fantasy Pools:</span> pools requiring Users to make selections from
      the participants in an event to score points;
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      <span>Survivor Pools:</span> pools requiring Users to make regular
      selections in a series of events to remain in the pool and where the last
      User left in wins.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      The rules governing the gameplay for each pool type are set out in detail
      in the Pool Rules. These rules cover all the general aspects of how to
      enter Pools as well as specific rules for each sport and game type.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      Pools are available for entering before and up to the Start Time which is
      set out in the pool details. If an event begins early, or MiPools puts up
      an erroneous Start Time, entries made after the actual start time (for
      whatever reason) may be void if it is deemed to have allowed a User an
      unfair advantage.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      At the End Time for each pool (or soon after), the pool will be closed and
      the Net Prizefund (the Prizefund after the deduction of the Platform Fee)
      will be distributed to the winning entries. The process for settling the
      pools and distributing the Prizefunds is described in paragraph 5.5 (Pool
      Settlement and Payout Structure).
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      We will determine which pools are published on the Website, when the pools
      are open for entering and when they close at our absolute discretion.
    </p>

    <h4 class="small-subhead">5.3 Pool Sizes</h4>
    <p class="panel-text">For each pool type, we will offer:</p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      <span>Standard & Free to Play Pools</span>; Most pools have limits on the
      number of entries one player can join. Please always check the rules for
      this limit. Users cannot enter the same pool with the same Predictions,
      Picks or Selections. Players can only join Free to Play once.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      <span>10 Max pools</span> which are limited to 10 Users per pool
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      <span>Heads Up pools</span> which are limited to 2 Users per pool.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      Users can enter multiple 10 Max and Heads Up pools with the same
      selections or different selections) but all multiple entries will be
      assigned to different pools (in other words you can enter each pool only
      once).
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      10 Max and Heads Up pools will go ‘live’ only if the minimum number of
      players is achieved by the Start Time. If a pool has not attracted the
      minimum number of entries by the Start Time it will be void and entry fees
      will be refunded in full.
    </p>

    <h4 class="small-subhead">5.4 Entering a pool/Striking a bet</h4>
    <p class="panel-text">
      The only way to enter Pools is online through a User Account. MiPools does
      not accept cash or telephone bets.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      When entering a pool, you will be asked to confirm your entry and choose
      your stakes. As soon as we have received this confirmation, your bet (or
      entry in the pool) is deemed to have been made and the stake(s) will
      (subject to having sufficient funds or points in your User Account) be
      debited from your account and added to the Prizefund(s) for the relevant
      pool(s). This pool will appear in the My Pools section of the User’s Lobby
      page.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      You can edit your selections any time prior to the Start Time.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      Once you have entered a pool, a bet has been struck and you may not cancel
      the bet or exit the pool, other than in the circumstances set out in
      paragraph 5.6 (Cancelled Events/Voiding Pools). It is your responsibility
      to ensure the details of your bets are correct before you confirm your
      entry into a pool.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      If a User enters a pool or edits their answer(s) in a pool AFTER the
      stated Start Time, for whatever reason, that entry may be invalid and
      excluded from the Pool in which case the entry fee will be debited from
      the Prizefund and refunded to the User’s Account.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      MiPools reserves the right to decline any bet or void any pool entry
      without explanation.
    </p>

    <h4 class="small-subhead">5.5 Pool Settlement and Prizefund Payout</h4>
    <p class="panel-text">
      Pools will be settled as soon as reasonably practicable following the End
      Time of the pool (or such other time as is defined in the Pool Rules).
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      MiPools relies on data provided to us by Sports Radar and/or other third
      party data providers, to be used as the source data to determine pool
      results. If the data provider does not provide the relevant data to settle
      a pool, MiPoolsreserves the right to settle the pool based on alternative
      publically available information sources as it may, at its discretion,
      determine. If no alternative public information is available the relevant
      pool or question may be void. See paragraph 5.6 (Cancelled Events/Voiding
      Pools).
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      If there is an investigation or dispute, data provided to us by a third
      party provider, evidence that supports alternative public information
      and/or our transaction log will be provided as supporting evidence.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      When a pool is settled the Net Prizefund is calculated (the total entry
      fees in the pool minus the Platform Fee) and paid out to the Users in the
      prize positions when all relevant results have been updated and finalised.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      The payout structure of a pool is determined by the number of entrants in
      the pool and the table structure (ie Unlimited, 10 Max, Heads Up etc). The
      standard payout structure for unlimited pools will add more prizes the
      more entries are in the pool as detailed below. The payout structure is
      always stated in the pool description at the top of the pool, but the
      number of prizes awarded and the prizes themselves may change as more
      players enter.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      Most standard pools follow a Top three payout structure which is as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text indent">
      &#x25A0; 1st place 70%, 2nd place 20%, 3rd place 10%
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text indent">
      &#x25A0; (with exception of the weekly football jackpot rollover, daily
      race and football matchrollover)
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text indent">
      &#x25A0; Each pool has the ability to use its own individual payout
      structure which is always displayed in the individual game 'How to play'
      page(s).
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      Fantasy Pools with Target Score (unless otherwise stated):
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text indent">
      &#x25A0; for Fantasy pools that require Users to reach a target score to
      win the pool 100% of the Net Prizefund will go to the winner(s).
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      Survivor Unlimited Pools (unless otherwise stated):
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text indent">
      &#x25A0; 100% of the Net Prizefund goes to the User(s) who last(s)
      longest.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">Predictor And Fantasy 10 Max Pools:</p>
    <p class="panel-text indent">
      &#x25A0; for a full table of ten Users 66.7% of the net Prizefund will be
      paid to the Winner of each pool and 33.3% will be paid to the Runner-Up in
      each pool. If the pool contains between 2 and 9 Users 100% of the pool
      will go to the winner.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">Survivor 10 Max Pools:</p>
    <p class="panel-text indent">
      &#x25A0; 100% of the Net Prizefund goes to the User(s) who last(s)
      longest.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">Heads Up Pools (Predictor, Fantasy or Survivor):</p>
    <p class="panel-text indent">
      &#x25A0; 100% of the Net Prizefund will always be paid to the winner(s) of
      the pool.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      Unless otherwise stated, if two or more Users tie for a position, the
      relevant Prizes are added together and divided by the number of tied Users
      to calculate the amount awarded to each User.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      For example: if three Users tie for 2nd Prize, then 2nd, 3rd and 4th
      Prizes (if there are 3rd and 4th Prizes) will be added together and split
      equally between the three tying Users. The amount of the Prize will be
      added to the User’s balance immediately after the Pool has settled.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">Prizes will be rounded to the nearest penny.</p>

    <h4 class="small-subhead">5.9 Rollover Pools</h4>
    <p class="panel-text">
      For some pools, designated as Rollover Pools in the pool title and header,
      the prizefund will only be paid out in the event that one or more players
      answer all the questions in the pool correctly and precisely.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      There is generally only one prize in Rollover Pools which may be shared by
      more than one winning player. Some Rollover Pools may payout consolation
      prizes or dividends for "near misses". Details of these will be published
      in the Pool Rules.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      If a Rollover Pool is not won, the prizefund, minus the platform Fee, will
      "rollover" to the next designated Rollover Pool. This process will
      continue until the prizefund is won.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      If the result of a question in a Rollover Pool is void under the standard
      Pool Rules, so the Rollover Prizefund cannot be won and "near miss"
      dividends are not available, then any player(s) that answered all the
      other questions correctly and precisely will be reimbursed their entry
      fee(s).
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      If a Rollover Pool is void, under the standard Pool Rules, then any entry
      fees added to the existing pool will be returned, no platform Fee will be
      charged and the remaining prizefund will "rollover" to the next designated
      Rollover Pool.

    <h4 class="small-subhead">15.2 Progressive Jackpot</h4>
    <p class="panel-text">
      MiPools is currently offering a Progressive Jackpot which gives all
      registered Users the opportunity to win a Prize offered by MiPools by
      answering all the questions correctly in certain designated pools.
      Progressive Jackpot pools will be designated by the Progressive Jackpot
      symbol (PJ).
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      The amount of the Progressive Jackpot Prizefund is published on the
      Website and updated regularly. If a player wins the Progressive Jackpot
      they 75% of the progressive jackpot balance will be paid out to the
      winner(s) (minus tax and administration fee) and 25% will be added to the
      next progressive Jackpot balance.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      Only some Unlimited Predictor pools are designated “Progressive Jackpot”
      and labelled accordingly. To qualify to win the Progressive Jackpot a User
      must enter one of these pre-designated pools AND pay the Progressive
      Jackpot entry fee (currently £1 or 100 Points).
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      Having entered a Progressive Jackpot and paid the Progressive Jackpot
      entry fee, to win the Progressive Jackpot, a User must correctly and
      precisely predict ALL of the outcomes of ALL questions in the relevant
      pool. If any question in a Progressive Jackpot designated pool is void,
      the Progressive Jackpot cannot be won in that Pool and any Progressive
      Jackpot stakes will be refunded in full.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      For example, for the question "How many goals will be scored in the
      match?", if 5 goals were scored, the user would have to select the answer
      "5 or (more)" to answer correctly and precisely. If they had selected "3
      (or more)" or "4 (or more)", they would not have selected the precise
      answer.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      For the purposes of winning the Progressive Jackpot, answers will be
      rounded to the nearest option which was available for users to select as
      an outcome. So if the possible answers for a quesion were provided in
      steps of 5, (e.g. 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 etc) and the outcome is not a multiple
      of 5, the outcome will be rounded to the nearest 5 for the purposes of
      winning the Progressive Jackpot.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      The Progressive Jackpot prize will be equal to 75% of the balance at the
      time (minus Pools Betting Duty of 15% and Administration Fee of 10%). The
      balance of 25% will be paid into the next progressive jackpot.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      In the event that two or more Users win the Progressive Jackpot in the
      same pool or on the same day, the Progressive Jackpot Prizefund will be
      shared between these Users.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      To receive the Progressive Jackpot a User will be required to provide
      documents as evidence of their age, identity and address. Employees of
      MiPools are not eligible to win the Progressive Jackpot.
    </p>
    <h4 class="small-subhead">15.3 Jackpot bonus</h4>
    <p class="panel-text">
      Some pools, designated with a "£1M" symbol in the Pools Lobby, carry a £1
      million jackpot bonus which can be won by any player that enters the pool
      and successfully meets the winning criteria for winning the Jackpot Bonus,
      which will always be stated in the Pool Description. Jackpot pools cannot
      be entered using points (see paragraph 6.2 above) and can only be entered
      with cash. The Jackpot Bonus cannot be won in Challenge pools and can only
      be won in public pools available to all players on the Website.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      To win a Jackpot Bonus in a Predictor or Fantasy pool, the User must
      answer each question correctly and precisely and according to the Rules.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      To win a Jackpot Bonus in a Survivor "streak" pool, the User must make the
      specified number of correct selections in a row. For Football Survivor
      Jackpot pools, this is 20 correct selections in a row; for a Golf Survivor
      Jackpot pool this would require 10 correct selections in a row.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      Only one Jackpot Bonus can be won in any one pool; so if two (or more)
      players win the Jackpot Bonus in the same pool, which can be two different
      tables or stake sizes in the same pool (eg the £5 table AND the £25 table
      in the same Survivor pool), the Jackpot Bonus will be shared by these
      players.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      Only Users with accounts that have been fully verified prior to entering
      can win the Jackpot Bonus and only entries that are made prior to the pool
      start time will qualify (ie with a time stamp before the Close date of the
      pool). Any User that meets the winning criteria for the Jackpot will be
      required to provide proof of age and address before receiving their
      Jackpot prize.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      If any question in a Jackpot Pool is voided, the Jackpot bonus cannot be
      won.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      Jackpot pools carry an extra fee which is added to the normal platform Fee
      for each Jackpot pool.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      The Jackpot Bonus is arranged by a third party, Risq Capital Limited, and
      any winning Jackpot bonus will only be paid out after the winning entry
      and the winning player's details have been verified and agreed by them.
    </p>
    <p class="panel-text">
      Employees of MiPools, or any associated company, are not eligible to win
      the Jackpot Bonus.
